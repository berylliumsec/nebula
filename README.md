## News

Introducing the Deep Application Profiler (DAP). DAP uses neural networks to analyze an executable's internal structure and intent, rather than relying on traditional virus signatures. This approach enables it to detect new, zero-day malware that conventional methods often miss. DAP also provides detailed breakdowns for rapid analyst review and is available as both a web service and an API. [Learn More Here](https://www.berylliumsec.com/dap-overview)


Introducing Nebula Pro, Nebula Pro improves on Nebula 2.0 by adding additional features such as autonomous mode, code analysis and more. [Learn More Here](https://www.berylliumsec.com/nebula-pro-overview)

## Nebula: AI-Driven Penetration Testing Platform

Nebula is a cutting-edge toolkit designed for penetration testers. It integrates AI Models right into the command line interface and supports any tool that can be invoked from the CLI


## Installation

```bash
conda create --name nebula-2.0 python=3.11
conda install conda-forge::poetry
poetry install
python -m pip install nebula-ai --upgrade
```

## Running Nebula

**important**

The first time you run Nebula, it will ask you to select a cache dir. The cache dir is where it will download the Model that you choose. For the models, you will need to create a free [Hugging Face Account](https://huggingface.co/), agree to the terms, generate an access token and export it to your CLI like so:


```bash
export HF_TOKEN=Your Token
```

This step only needs to be completed once. Monitor the command line interface where you invoked `nebula` from to monitor the download progress.

## Key Features

### AI-Assisted Note-Taking
Automatically records pivotal security findings, categorizes them with CWE-IDs, and aligns them with NIST controls when applicable.

### Real-Time AI-Driven Insights
Provides immediate suggestions for discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities, based on outputs from integrated terminal tools.

### Enhanced Tool Integration
Seamlessly import data from external tools to capitalize on AI-powered note-taking and receive instant advice.

### Integrated Screenshot and Editing
Facilitates capturing and editing images within the toolkit for streamlined documentation.

### Manual Note-Taking
Offers a dedicated space for user-driven documentation, complementing the AI's automated notes. (Notes are auto-saved)

### Automatic Command Logging
Keeps a record of all commands executed within the terminal for easy reference and analysis.

## Getting Started

### Intuitive User Interface
Designed for ease of use, with tooltips for quick guidance and icons that intuitively represent their functions.
