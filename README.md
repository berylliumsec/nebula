## Acknowledgement

**First i would like to thank the All-Mighty God who is the source of all knowledge, without Him, this would not be possible.**

## News

Introducing the Deep Application Profiler (DAP). DAP uses neural networks to analyze an executable's internal structure and intent, rather than relying on traditional virus signatures. This approach enables it to detect new, zero-day malware that conventional methods often miss. DAP also provides detailed breakdowns for rapid analyst review and is available as both a web service and an API. [Learn More Here](https://www.berylliumsec.com/dap-overview)


Introducing Nebula Pro, Nebula Pro improves on Nebula 2.0 by adding additional features such as autonomous mode, code analysis and more. [Learn More Here](https://www.berylliumsec.com/nebula-pro-overview)

## Nebula: AI-Powered Penetration Testing Platform

Nebula is a cutting-edge, AI-powered penetration testing tool designed for cybersecurity professionals and ethical hackers. It integrates advanced open-source AI models such as Meta's Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Mistralai's Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B—directly into the command line interface (CLI). By leveraging these state-of-the-art models, Nebula not only enhances vulnerability assessments and penetration testing workflows but also supports any tool that can be invoked from the CLI.


## Installation

**System Requirements:**

For GPU-Based Inference (huggingface):

- At least 8GB of GPU memory (tested with 12GB)
- Python 3.11 or higher

For CPU-Based Inference(Ollama)(Note that Ollama Supports GPU too):
- At least 16GB of RAM 
- Python 3.11 or higher
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)

**Installation Command:**
```bash
python -m pip install nebula-ai --upgrade
```


## Running Nebula

**Important:** 

**Hugging Face Local Model Based Usage** 
On your first run, you’ll be prompted to select a cache directory where Nebula will download your chosen AI model. Follow these steps:

1. Create a free [Hugging Face Account](https://huggingface.co/), agree to the terms, and generate an access token.
2. Export your token to the CLI:
   ```bash
   export HF_TOKEN=YourTokenHere
   ```
3. Launch Nebula and monitor the download progress on the CLI.

   ```bash
   nebula
   ```

This step only needs to be completed once. Monitor the command line interface where you invoked `nebula` from to monitor the download progress.

**Ollama Local Model Based Usage**

Install Ollama and download the three supported models (you can also download only the ones you'd be using):

```bash
 ollama pull mistral
 ollama pull deepseek-r1
 ollama pull llama3.1
 ```
### Interacting with the models. 

To interact with the models, begin your input with a `!` for example: `! write a python script to scan the ports of a remote system`
